# Odin Games Programming Template

This is my personal template for Odin games. Feel free to use this for any project you'd like.
If you'd like to request a feature or fix an issue, create a PR and I'll review & push it. :)

To run, execute the command:
`odin run src -out:out/your-project-name`

If you wish to build and not run, execute the command:
`odin build src -out:out/your-project-name`
(And then run `./out/your-project-name` if you'd like to run)
